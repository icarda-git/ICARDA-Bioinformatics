  description: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is essential for understanding genetic variations controlling phenotypic traits in all living organisms. The post-analysis of MSA results is a difficult step for researchers who do not have programming skills, especially those working with large scale data and looking for potential variations or variable sample groups. AlignStatPlot provides a robust ability to handle and visualize diversity data, offering both traditional and cutting-edge analyses on sequencing data and generating new visualization methods for MSA results.
