- title: "QBMS"
  image: QBMS.png
  description: This R package assists breeders in linking data systems with their analytic pipelines, a crucial step in digitizing breeding processes. It supports querying and retrieving phenotypic and genotypic data from systems like EBS, BMS, BreedBase, and GIGWA (using BrAPI calls). Extra helper functions support environmental data sources, including TerraClimate and FAO HWSDv2 soil database.

  image: SSR.png
  description: Short script written in Perl using regular expression techniques to detect SSR in sequences provided in FASTA file format and save the output in a tab-delimited text file. This code was developed for the study of Development of 1000 Microsatellite Markers across the Date Palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) Genome, which won the Khalifa International Date Palm Award for the most Distinguished Research/Studies in 2012.
